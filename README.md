Eniac-Magist Business deal
Eniac is an online marketplace specialised in Apple compatible accessories. The company is deciding an expansion to the Brazilian market. Here comes Magist. Magist is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralised order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces. Magist is already a big player and allows small companies to benefit from its economies of scale: it has signed advantageous contracts with the marketplaces and with the Post Office, thus reducing the cost in fees and, most importantly, the bureaucracy involved to get things started.

There are two main concerns:

Is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products?
Are orders delivered on time?
All code details are in project_sols.sql. Here we explored the Magist databse using MYSQL. I created Dashboards using TABLEAU which helped Eniac make decision about the business deal.
